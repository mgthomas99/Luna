# Luna
Lua OOP framework. Luna allows you to write classes and instantiate objects using familiar
syntax from other popular object-oriented languages such as Java and JavaScript.

# Using
To use Luna, reference it from your Lua script using the following code:
```
	package.path = package.path .. ";" .. "path/to/lib/folder"
	Luna = require("Luna/luna")
```
See `examples/importing-luna` for an example.
