# Luna
Lua OOP framework. Luna allows you to write classes and instantiate objects using familiar
syntax from other popular object-oriented languages such as Java and JavaScript.

There are some Luna examples in the `example` folder.

# Executing a Luna script
- [Install Lua](https://www.lua.org/download.html)
- Install Luna somewhere, and remember the absolute path of the `luna.lua` file.
- In the command prompt (or shell), use the command `lua -- luna.lua ["path" [, arg1, arg2, ..., argN]]`.
